# üöÄ Deployment Guide - Thread Agent

## Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

This guide shows how to deploy the Thread Agent to Hugging Face Spaces for online access.

### Method 1: Direct Upload to HF Spaces

1. **Create a new Space on Hugging Face**:
   - Go to [huggingface.co/new-space](https://huggingface.co/new-space)
   - Choose name: `thread-agent` or similar
   - Select **Gradio** as SDK
   - Set visibility as desired

2. **Upload files**:
   - Upload all files from this repository
   - Ensure `app.py` is the main file
   - Include `requirements.txt` and `.huggingface.yml`

3. **Configure Space**:
   - The Space will automatically use `app.py` as entry point
   - Set any required environment variables in Space settings

### Method 2: Git Push to HF Spaces

1. **Clone your new HF Space**:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/thread-agent
cd thread-agent
```

2. **Copy files from this repository**:
```bash
# Copy all files from this repo to the HF Space directory
cp -r /path/to/this/repo/* .
```

3. **Push to HF Spaces**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Thread Agent"
git push
```

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Local Testing**: The app works perfectly locally  
‚úÖ **Dependencies**: All requirements properly configured  
‚úÖ **Groq Integration**: Fixed compatibility issues  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Online Deployment**: Needs manual deployment to HF Spaces  

### Files Ready for Deployment
